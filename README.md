Complete and submit Programming Exercise #8 listed on Page 297, Chapter 7 of your textbook.  Use of C compiler and submission of compiled version of your C program is required to receive credits. Submit a screenshot of the executed program and the code of the program.

7. Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay, the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following: a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300 20% of the next $150 25% of the rest Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current tax law.  

8. Modify assumption a. in exercise 7 so that the program presents a menu of pay rates from which to choose. Use a switch to select the pay rate. The beginning of a run should look something like this:

*****************************************************************

 Enter the number corresponding to the desired pay rate or action:

1) $8.75/hr

2) $9.33/hr

3) $10.00/hr

4) $11.20/hr

5) quit

 *****************************************************************

If choices 1 through 4 are selected, the program should request the hours worked. The program should recycle until 5 is entered. If something other than choices 1 through 5 is entered, the program should remind the user what the proper choices are and then recycle. Use #defined constants for the various earning rates and tax rates.
